# advent-of-code-2018

> Solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) written in TypeScript

## Setup

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). For example, on a Mac:

```sh
$ brew install yarn
```

## Development

### `yarn`

This will install all necessary dependencies for tests, linting, and anything that may be used in the Advent of Code solution source (trying to stick to stdlib modules as much as possible).

### `yarn test`

After installing dependencies, you can then run this command to run the tests. Exits with a non-zero code if either tests fail; otherwise, exits with zero.
